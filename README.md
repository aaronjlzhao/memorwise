# Project Overview
Memorwise is a Firebase-powered vocabulary learning website that gamifies the process of learning English vocabulary for Chinese-speaking students. From interactive cartoon characters to colorful graphics, the website engages users with a gamified approach to learning vocabulary, an alternative to the current, crude method of raw memorization using pen and paper.
