# Project Overview
Memorwise is a Firebase-powered vocabulary learning website that gamifies the process of learning English vocabulary for Chinese-speaking students. From interactive cartoon characters to colorful graphics, the website engages users with a gamified approach to learning vocabulary, an alternative to the current, crude method of raw memorization using pen and paper. The website works by allowing users to complete different sets of virtual flashcards, rewarding the user with cartoon character encouragement, coins, and confetti.

As the lead developer of this project, I faciliated effective communcation between sub-teams (backend/frontend developers, UI/UX graphic designers, beta testers). Together, we created the first iteration of the website.
